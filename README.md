# Perfect-and-Prime-Numbers

Made in MIPS assembly.

The program determines if numbers input by a user are perfect or prime. It prompts the user, reads an integer value, shows the sum of the factors of the value that was read, and indicates whether or not the number is perfect. If it is not perfect, it indicates whether or not number entered is prime.
